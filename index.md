## Speech Corpus Tools

Speech Corpus Tools is a desktop application built to represent and query large scale speech corpora.  Speech Corpus Tools uses PolyglotDB to interact with multiple databases that are built for the kinds of data in speech corpora.  Neo4j contains the representations of the discourses and speech in time as a directed acyclic graph.  SQL databases contain the lexical, phonological and speaker information in table format, and also contain all of the calculated acoustic information.  Please see the manual for more information and tutorials (http://speech-corpus-tools.readthedocs.io/)
