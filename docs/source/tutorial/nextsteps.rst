**BELOW IS WHAT I STARTED WRITING BEFORE THINKING WE SHOULD JUST SHOW A COUPLE SCHEMATIC FIGURES, AND LEAVE A BLANK SPACE FOR STUFF THAT COMES UP FROM PARTICIPANTS**

Eventually, SCT will have documentation.  Until then, this section shows some illustrations of the types of information you can include in queries and exports.

For understanding these, it is important to understand the structure of objects in the SCT database, schematized in this example:

TODO (big schematic: "I like chocolate... really I do." )

Linguistics objects are in an *annotation graph* (Bird & Liberman, 2001), reflecting their sequential order in time. Graphs are formal objects consisting of *nodes* and *edges*.
Precedence in time is one kind of relationship between nodes; other relationships between nodes whcih are represented in SCT include hierarchical order (indicated by ??) and alignment (not shown).  The linguistic objects (i.e. nodes) also have *properties*, indicated in italics..

This database structure (nodes, edges, properties) contains several kinds of information, all of which can be used in queries or exports: 

* **Temporal**
    * Ex: Begining, end, duration of an object

* **Properties**
    * Ex: a word's frequency; a phone's major class; an utterance's speech rate

* **Hierarchical**
    * Ex: the containing word or utterance (for a phone)

* **Positional**: 
    * Ex: position of word in an utterance (1, 2, 3, ...)
    

## Examples

**To be filled in based on participant requests / own data.**
