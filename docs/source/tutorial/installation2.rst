Installation Guide
##################

At this point you should be set up to install SCT. If not, go back to [link to installation setup]. 

Downloading SCT itself can be done through the following links on Dropbox:

Mac: `<https://www.dropbox.com/s/hw3amns1y8qupb4/sct_alpha.dmg?dl=0>`_

Windows: `<https://www.dropbox.com/s/ew5dfffsnqdo9qh/sct_alpha.zip?dl=0>`_

Once those are downloaded, just extract the archive and the executable inside can be run.

One possible issue that might arise with Windows computers is related to graphics drivers.  On the Windows version, a console output will pop up in addition to the main SCT window.  If you notice a string of output containing something like "RuntimeError: OpenGL got errors" then your graphics driver is probably a couple of years old.  In which case, please email Michael (michael.e.mcauliffe@gmail.com) to walk you through the process to update it.  Macs tend to be better about keeping the graphics drivers up to date, and shouldn't have this issue.  SCT should run on Windows 7+ and Mac OSX 10.9+.
