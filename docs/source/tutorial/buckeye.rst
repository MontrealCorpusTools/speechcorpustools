Buckeye database
################

To do the examples below, you will need a SCT database for the Buckeye corpus.  Technically, this is a PolyglotDB database, which consists of two sub-databases: a Neo4j database (which contains the hierarchical representation of discourses), and a SQL database (which contains lexical and featural information, and cached acoustic measurements). Instructions are below for either using pre-made copies of these, or for making your own.

Use pre-made database
