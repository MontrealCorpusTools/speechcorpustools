General Background
==================

*Speech Corpus Tools* is an application for interacting with large scale
datasets.  It uses PolyglotDB as the underlying data storage, which allows
for consistent queries across a wide range of possible input formats.

Speech Corpus Tools is written in Python, which allows for Python scripts
to be written using its API, so advanced users can create their own queries
using Python, rather than SQL or Cypher (the underlying database languages).

In addition, Speech Corpus Tools provides a graphical user interface for
easily displaying annotations and speech in the database and the results
of queries.
