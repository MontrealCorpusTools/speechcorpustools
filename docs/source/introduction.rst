.. _general_background:


`Speech Corpus Tools
<https://github.com/MontrealCorpusTools/PolyglotDB>`_ is an
application for working with speech datasets, with a focus on
large-scale speech corpora. It uses
`PolyglotDB <https://github.com/MontrealCorpusTools/PolyglotDB/>`_ as
the underlying data storage, which allows for consistent queries
across a range of possible input formats.  `This presentation
<http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~morgan/molt2016.pdf>`_ describes
the motivation and design of SCT, as well as its application in a case
study of speech from 12 languages.

This site consists of two parts:

1. :any:`Tutorial <tutintroduction>`: a stand-alone page containing
   full instructions for installation of SCT, and worked examples
   using a sample dataset, providing an introduction to SCT's basic
   functionality.  We recommend the tutorial for first-time users of SCT.

2. :any:`Documentation <tour>`: the rest of the site, beginning at :any:`Navigation Tour <tour>`, provides documentation of SCT's functionality. The documentation is still in progress (July 2016), and questions not addressed here should be sent to michael.mcauliffe@gmail.com.
