Exporting Queries
*****************

To begin customizing your export profile, click on "Export query results". 
Much like while building a query, you can add filters indicating what you would like to export. Please note that these filters do not have to be the same as the ones you used to search for your data. The idea of this customization is to give the user more control over which data are shown, depending on the desired application. 

Exporting queries uses the same dropdown options as were available while `building queries <http://sct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/additional/buildingqueries.html>`_, so they will not be covered again. 

As before, simply click on the "+" bar to begin adding filters. Each filter you add will be a column in the file that is exported. When you are done, you can either save your export profile for future use by pressing "Save as...", or you can run your export profile without saving. You will be prompted to provide a filename and destination for the file to be written.
