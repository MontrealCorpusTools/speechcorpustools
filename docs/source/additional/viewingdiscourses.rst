Viewing Discourses
******************


After completing a query, it might be useful to take a closer look at the discourse, or file, that a result came from. To this end, SCT has the 'Discourse' window on the bottom left.

The user is presented with two windows inside of the 'Discourse' window. The top one shows the waveform of the file as well as the transcriptions of word, phone, and utterance(?)

The bottom window is a spectrogram. This maps time and frequency on the X and Y axes respectively, while the darkeness of an area indicates the amplitude. Lines generated by the software also indicate pitch and formants when available.

Right now they are both blank, since we haven't analyzed the acoustics yet.
All this will become available by first selecting "Analyze acoustics" in the enrichment menu, and then clicking on a discourse either in the "Discourse" tab of the top right window (right next to "Connection"),

or by double-clicking on a result from a query in the "Query \#" tab\*.

\* **NB** A successful query must first be run for this tab to appear 

Now something like this should be displayed:

The waveform is displayed, with annotations that can be toggled on and off by clicking the text

as well as the spectrogram, whose features can similarly be toggled on and off.
