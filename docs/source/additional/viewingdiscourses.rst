Viewing Discourses
******************


After completing a query, it might be useful to take a closer look at the discourse, or file, that a result came from. To this end, SCT has the 'Discourse' window on the bottom left.

The user is presented with two windows inside of the 'Discourse' window. The top one shows the waveform of the file as well as the transcriptions of words and phones.

The bottom window is a spectrogram. This maps time and frequency on the X and Y axes respectively, while the darkeness of an area indicates the amplitude. Lines generated by the software also indicate pitch and formants when available.

Pitch and formants will only become available by first selecting "Analyze acoustics" in the enrichment menu. Viewing one of the discourses' acoustic information can be done by clicking on a discourse either in the "Discourse" tab of the top right window (right next to "Connection"),

or by double-clicking on a result from a query in the "Query \#" tab\*.

\* **NB** A successful query must first be run for this tab to appear 

Now something like this should be displayed:
